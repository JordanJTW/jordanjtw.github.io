Hoping to start blogging about my vairous electronic and software projects, mostly as a self reference to document my progress, and my views on various aspects of the tech industry. 

Florida born and raised; I've spent the last four years studying Computer Engineering at UCF and will be heading out to California in less than a year to work for [Google](https://www.google.com). If you're interested, you can find out more [here](about.html).

Hope to write more soon!
